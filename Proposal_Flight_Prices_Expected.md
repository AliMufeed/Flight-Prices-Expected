# **Flight Prices Expected**

### **Backstory:**

Traveling by air used to be luxurious method of travel. However, low-cost flight will give the opportunity for ordinary people to travel too. A new airline company want to operate its flight from Europe to Riyadh and to do so they need to analyse the cost of existing airlines. Therefore, we chose to look at an important factor in selecting a flight which is the price.

We will focus on the prices of flights from 11 countries in Europ to RIYADH (RUH) operated by many airlines. Would there be a way to predict, with any accuracy, the coast of a particular flight on this route? For the scope of this project, we will collect available price information which is our target by scraping data from Almosafer.com. Our hypothesis that some correlation might be found between the coast of a flight and many other factors such as time of day, class, duration, number of stops, airline and month of year. We will use these features and others to build a linear regression model in an attempt to predict the price of flights on this route.

### **Tools:**

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in pandas. Python visualization libraries matplotlib and seaborn.
- Querying database into Python via scraping data from website using BeautifulSoup &amp; selenium.
